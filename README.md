# BenchGNN
A simple project of benchmarking GNN and DNN for comparison


Run experiments:
```
# You can comment out the corresponding codes in the main to individually run different part of experiments
python main.py
```

For MNIST dataset, it may take some time to prepare.

And the experiment results are saved in log* files. You can run
```
python draw.py
```
to get figures of experiment results.
